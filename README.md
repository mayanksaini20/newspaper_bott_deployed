# Newspaper Bot Deployed

This project is a Telegram bot designed to process images of Hindi newspapers. It extracts news articles from the images and converts them into audio files, allowing users to listen to the news in Hindi.

## Features

- **Article Detection**: Utilizes a modified YOLOv8 architecture to detect and extract news articles from newspaper images.
- **Text Extraction**: Employs Tesseract OCR to convert the extracted article images into text.
- **Audio Conversion**: Uses gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert the extracted text into audio files.
- **Telegram Integration**: The bot operates within Telegram, allowing users to interact by sending newspaper images and receiving audio news.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Creation**: A dataset is created by annotating newspaper images with bounding boxes around articles using a modified YOLOv8 architecture.
2. **Model Training**: The YOLOv8 model is trained on this dataset to detect articles in newspaper images.
3. **Article Extraction**: The trained model detects and extracts article regions from new newspaper images.
4. **Text Recognition**: Tesseract OCR converts the extracted article images into text.
5. **Audio Generation**: gTTS converts the recognized text into audio files.
6. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the bot on Telegram by sending newspaper images and receiving the corresponding audio news.
